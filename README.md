Ordinary people have never been that lucky to access the information before today. This fascinating fact makes me excited about the opportunity to learn and grow. If we respect the diï¬€erences between cultures, we can leverage them for us to feed our intellectual potential. 

All the years that Iâ€™ve spent within diï¬€erent international teams Iâ€™ve had a chance to be a witness of it. Within this period I understand the diï¬€erences of the nuances, learned to adopt and most importantly appreciated the diversity. This appreciation enhanced my vision and showed me the way of improve both my technical and soft skills.

### Did you check that ?

If you are looking for someone who has 3+ year experience, who appreciates the diversity, who is the both seeker and the early adaptor of the new technologies, letâ€™s have a talk.

If you are curious reader like me you would like to follow my newsletter. In this newsletter, you will get a list of interesting links from me. You can expect to see different topics including technology, entrepreneurship, software engineering practices but not limited to those.

I'm also a coffee lover, history enthusiastic, and a person who is in pursuit of valuable ideas. So sometimes you may see links from out of the scope. I specifically used the word 'links' because this newsletter is open to any kind of digital resource that you get to benefit from.

itâ€™s time to unlearn well known to make a room for new learning. [Did you check that ?](https://news.cagataytanyildiz.com)
